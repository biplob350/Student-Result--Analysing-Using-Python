## 🔍 Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**
   - Loaded the dataset using pandas
   - Removed unnecessary columns (`Unnamed: 0`)
   - Checked for null values and data types

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized gender distribution
   - Grouped scores by:
     - Parental Education Level
     - Marital Status
     - Ethnic Group
   - Generated heatmaps for score averages
   - Identified outliers and performance patterns

3. **Insight Extraction**
   - Correlated parental background with student scores
   - Assessed trends across gender and ethnicity
   - Highlighted potential factors affecting student outcomes

---

## 📈 Key Findings

- **Gender:** More female students in the dataset, with some scoring trends observed.
- **Parental Education:** Higher education levels correlate with better student performance.
- **Marital Status:** Slight variations in average scores based on marital status.
- **Ethnicity:** Certain ethnic groups showed consistent scoring patterns.
- **Outliers:** Present across all subjects, suggesting diverse learning levels.
